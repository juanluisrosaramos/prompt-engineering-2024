# Lesson Title

## Lesson Overview :pencil2:

In this first lesson, **you will learn how to interact with LLMs by the use of prompting** and explore the power of LLMs as a developer tool, using API calls to LLMs to quickly build software applications. You'll delve into OpenAI's roles and how to provide the necessary instructions to the model through the use of prompting best practices and make it behave as desired.
