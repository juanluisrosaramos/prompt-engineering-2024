# Lab

- Multiple exercises put together so students can reinforce what they learned today (and potentially some days before). Labs are formative assessments and the goal is for students to gain skills and for the instructional team to get an understanding of their progress. Labs are checked only for submission and students will not get individual (personalized) feedback. Labs can be reviewed during the week or the following week  - or at least the most challenging labs should be reviewed with students (this is a good time for TA(s) to take the lead and also to engage students in reviewing their work).
    
**Types of labs:**
    
- lab for a day
- lab for a week (or multiple days) - where students go and in phases build a piece of something every day to have the full "app" (or mini-project) by the end of the week.
    - The risk: if a student doesn't complete some of the steps they are not able to move forward and work on the next one. This usually causes frustration to students.
    
🙌 Hint: Some labs start from scratch and some could start from starter code provided.
